    //   "chat with requester" link
    // You can try it now, although the practice job requester is probably
    //   not online
    
    /* Editing and Running Code */
    
    // Edit the code so the main method below prints "Hello, world!"
    // Now open the console: click the "Show Console" button in the toolbar
    //   to open the console in a separate tab
    // In that console tab, click the green run button (just opening the
    //   console does not run the program)

    /* Running Tests */
    
    // The projects you work on might have JUnit tests (or they might not)
    // To run the tests, click the "Run Tests" button in the toolbar
    // When the tests are done, results will appear in the sidebar
    
    @Test public void testTesting() {

    /* More Features */
    
    // This editor has some of the same features as Eclipse:
    // - Hover over error and warning markers in the margin to see details
    // - Use ctrl-space to use code completion (or pause after typing '.')
    // - Use ctrl-shift-o to use organize imports
    
    /* Finish a Job */
    
    // When you finish a job, or have worked on it for about 15 minutes,
    //   you should click "work complete" in the top right corner
    // When you're done with this tutorial, click "work complete" :)
